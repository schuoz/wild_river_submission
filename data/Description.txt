ICS-River-Edges.gpkg: Predicted Intactness scores aggregated for each reach of the SWORD river network. For each reach in the feature class, we have the following attributes: {\bf reach\_id}: SWORD's reach ID, reach averaged ICS from 2019 to 2024 (columns {\bf ICS\_2019}-{\bf ICS\_2024}), and their corresponding Uncertainty ({\bf ICS\_Uncert\_2019}-{\bf ICS\_Uncert\_2024}). Furthermore, for each reach, we report the ICS trend ({\bf TREND}) and the percentage of change ({\bf PERC\_CHANGE}), {\bf MK} stands for the Mann-Kendall test for the trend, {\bf MKPVAL} stands for p-vlaue of the Mann-Kendall test.

ICS-Hexagon.gpkg: Hexagon averaged values of ICS for the year 2019 and 2024 with attributes: {\bf ICS2019} and {\bf ICS2024}, hexagon averaged trend values {\bf AVG\_TREND}, standard deviation of trend within each hexagon {\bf STD\_TREND}, count of reaches in each hexagon {\bf COUNT\_REACHES} and Number of threatened freshwater species ({\bf NUM}).

Annotation.csv: Contains metadata for each sampled river site, including its location ({\bf LAT}, {\bf LON}), mean intactness level ({\bf TRUESKILL\_MEAN}), the standard deviation of intactness representing uncertainty ({\bf TRUESKILL\_STD}), and the image capture date ({\bf DATE}).
